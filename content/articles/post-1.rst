The goal of Least Squares is to find a mathematical model, or an approximate model, of some relationship, given some observed data or measurements or sampled signals.

Formulation
-----------

Suppose we have an n-vector :math:`x`, and a scalar :math:`y`, and we believe that they are related, perhaps approximately, by some function :math:`f : \mathbb{R}^n â†’ \mathbb{R}`:

.. math::
    y \approx f(x)

The vector :math:`x` might represent a set of n feature values, and is called the *feature vector* or the vector of *independent variables*, depending on the context. The scalar :math:`y` represents some *outcome* (also called *response variable*) that we are interested in.
